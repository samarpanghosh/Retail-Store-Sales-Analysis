     2.  Association Rule Mining (Market Basket Analysis) using Apriori Algorithm

Market Basket Analysis for an organization to identify the most frequently selling products in order to devise cross-selling marketing strategies.

Frequent Itemset Mining:
Frequent patterns are patterns (such as item sets, subsequences, or substructures) that appear in a data set frequently. For example, a set of items, such as milk and bread, that appear frequently together in a transaction data set is a frequent itemset. Finding such frequent patterns plays an essential role in mining associations, correlations, and many other interesting relationships among data. A typical example of frequent itemset mining is Market Basket Analysis. This process analyzes customer buying habits by finding associations between the different items that customers place in their “shopping baskets”. Discovery of such associations and correlations amongst products in a customer’s basket is known by the term Association Rule Mining.


3. RFM Analysis


RFM analysis is a marketing technique used to analyze customer behavior and segment customers based on their past interactions with a business. The acronym RFM stands for:

Recency (R): This refers to the time elapsed since a customer's last purchase or interaction with the company. Customers who have interacted more recently are considered more engaged and likely to make future purchases.

Frequency (F): This represents the number of times a customer has made a purchase or engaged with the company within a specific time period. Customers with higher frequencies are considered more loyal.

Monetary Value (M): This indicates the total amount of money a customer has spent with the company within a certain time frame. Customers with higher monetary values are considered high-value customers.
